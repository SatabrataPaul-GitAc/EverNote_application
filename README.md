## Tech Stacks Used (Full Stack Development):
- **Front End Design** :
     + HTML5
     + CSS (Cascading Styling Sheets)
     + Bootstrap 4 
     + Minimal Javascript (JS)
- **Backend Design** :
     + FLASK in Python
- **Webserver and WSGI Server** :
     + Nginx 
     + Gunicorn
<br />

**NOTE** : Nginx and Gunicorn play an important role . FLASK as a web development framework is not suitable enough for production environment. 
This is because , it is unable to handle high amount of traffic. That's where Nginx and Gunicorn comes into the picture,  providing support with static and dynamic proxies to the application code in the server .
